      <h2>Backstory</h2>
       <p class="indent p1 maintext">Dr. Siebren De Kuiper (a.k.a. Sigma) is an astrophysicist from the Netherlands who was previously working on the International Space Station. One day, an experiment of his involving black holes went wrong and he was exposed to cosmic gravitational powers. </p>
        <p class="indent p2 maintext">The exposure, while brief, caused him to suffer immense psychological damage. Due to this he was contained and put under intensive care in a secret government facilty. Being deemed unsafe, he was detained for years under the name "Subject Sigma".</p>
         <p class="indent p3 maintext">Eventually, Talon caught wind of his existance and sent in Sombra, Reaper, and Widowmaker to retrieve him. To this day, Talon uses Sigma and his research for their own benefit.</p>  
      <h2>In Overwatch</h2>
        <p class="indent p4 maintext">In the game Overwatch & Overwatch 2, Sigma is a Tank class character. His primary weapon is two floating hyperspheres that cause damage on impact as well as dealing splash damage. He also has an ability called Kinetic Grasp that allows him to summon a black hole in his hand to absorb projectiles in front of him and turn them into shields for himself. Another ability he has gained is called Accretion which involves Sigma gathering a large mass of debris and throwing it at enemies. He has a shield that he can deploy in front of him to protect himself and his allies. Finally, his ultimate ability is Gravitic Flux, which manipulates gravity to bring enemies into the air and then slams them down doing serious blunt force trauma damage.</p>
